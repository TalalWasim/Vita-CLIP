> **Abstract:**
>*Adopting contrastive image-text pretrained models like CLIP towards video classification has gained attention due to its cost-effectiveness and competitive performance. However, recent works in this area face a trade-off. Finetuning the pretrained model to achieve strong supervised performance results in low zero-shot generalization. Similarly, freezing the backbone to retain zero-shot capability causes significant drop in supervised accuracy. Because of this, recent works in literature typically train separate models for supervised and zero-shot action recognition.
In this work, we propose a multimodal prompt learning scheme that works to balance the supervised and zero-shot performance under a single **unified** training. Our prompting approach on the vision side caters for three aspects: 1) Global **video-level** prompts to model the data distribution; 2) Local **frame-level** prompts to provide per-frame discriminative conditioning; and 3) a **summary prompt** to extract a condensed video representation. Additionally, we define a prompting scheme on the text side to augment the textual context.
Through this prompting scheme, we can achieve state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on Kinetics-600, HMDB51 and UCF101 while remaining competitive in the supervised setting. By keeping the pretrained backbone frozen, we optimize a much lower number of parameters and retain the existing general representation which helps achieve the strong zero-shot performance.*

## Environment Setup
Refer to `requirements.txt` for installing all python dependencies. We use python 3.8.13 with pytorch 1.14.0. 

## Supervised Training

### Dataset Preparation

We download the official version of Kinetics-400 from [here](https://github.com/cvdfoundation/kinetics-dataset) and videos are resized using code [here](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmaction2/tree/master/tools/data/kinetics).

We expect that `--train_list_path` and `--val_list_path` command line arguments to be a data list file of the following format
```
<path_1>,<label_1>
<path_2>,<label_2>
...
<path_n>,<label_n>
```
where `<path_i>` points to a video file, and `<label_i>` is an integer between `0` and `num_classes - 1`.
`--num_classes` should also be specified in the command line argument.

Additionally, `<path_i>` might be a relative path when `--data_root` is specified, and the actual path will be
relative to the path passed as `--data_root`.

The class mappings in the open-source weights are provided at [Kinetics-400 class mappings](data/k400_class_mappings.json)

### Download Pretrained CLIP Checkpoint

Download the pretrained CLIP checkpoint and place under the `pretrained directory`.

### Training Instruction

For supervised training on the Kinetics-400 dataset, use the train script in the `train_scripts` directory. Modify the `--train_list_path`, `--train_list_val` according to the data location and modify the `--backbone_path` according to location where the pretrained checkpoint was downloaded and stored.
